# ToDoList React App

This project is my first-ever React app aimed at learning React fundamentals while building a functional ToDoList application. The goals of this app are to gain hands-on experience with React components, state management, user interactions, and integration with third-party authentication (Google Sign-In).

## Getting Started

To view and interact with the app, visit the GitHub Pages deployment: [View ToDoList App](https://jordan-thirkle.github.io/todo-list-app/)

## Features

1. **Task Management:** Implement basic task management, allowing users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. This will introduce me to React's component structure, state management, and event handling.

2. **Google Sign-In:** Integrate Google Sign-In to provide users with the ability to save their tasks across sessions. This feature will help me understand third-party authentication integration and data persistence.

3. **Enhanced Styling:** Improve the visual appeal of the app through CSS styling. This will provide experience in styling React components and enhancing the user interface.

4. **Task Completion Tracking:** Implement a feature that allows users to track completed tasks separately. This will deepen my understanding of conditional rendering and dynamic content in React.

5. **Task Edit:** Add the ability to edit task descriptions after they are added. This feature will expand my knowledge of user interactions and controlled components in React.

6. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the app is responsive and looks good on various screen sizes and devices. This will involve using media queries and responsive design principles.

## What I'll Learn

1. **React Fundamentals:** Gain a solid understanding of React components, JSX, state, props, and the component lifecycle.

2. **State Management:** Learn how to manage and update component state to reflect changes in the user interface.

3. **Event Handling:** Understand how to handle user interactions and trigger actions within React components.

4. **Third-Party Authentication:** Learn how to integrate third-party authentication services (Google Sign-In) into a React app.

5. **CSS Styling:** Practice styling React components using CSS, and enhance the app's visual appeal.

6. **Conditional Rendering:** Discover how to conditionally render components and content based on user actions or data.

7. **Responsive Design:** Learn how to make the app responsive and ensure a consistent user experience across devices.
